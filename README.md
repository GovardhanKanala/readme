Sure! Here’s a user story for deploying Kyverno into a workload infrastructure account:

**Title:** Deploy Kyverno into Workload Infrastructure Account

**As a DevOps Engineer,**  
I want to deploy Kyverno into the workload infrastructure account,  
so that I can enforce Kubernetes policies and ensure compliance across our clusters.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Setup and Configuration:**
- Kyverno should be installed and configured in the workload infrastructure account.
- Ensure that Kyverno is running as a Kubernetes dynamic admission controller.

**Policy Creation:**
- Create initial policies to enforce naming conventions, resource limits, and network access restrictions.
- Policies should be defined using Kubernetes objects like ConfigMaps and Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs).

**Policy Validation:**
- Validate that the created policies are correctly enforced across the clusters.
- Ensure that any policy violations trigger appropriate actions, such as blocking deployments or removing non-compliant pods.

**Documentation:**
- Provide documentation on how to create, apply, and manage Kyverno policies.
- Include examples of common policies and their expected outcomes.

**Testing:**
- Conduct thorough testing to ensure Kyverno is functioning as expected.
- Test various scenarios to confirm that policies are enforced and violations are handled correctly.

**Monitoring and Alerts:**
- Set up monitoring to track Kyverno’s performance and policy enforcement.
- Configure alerts for policy violations and other critical events.

**Notes:**
- Kyverno should integrate seamlessly with existing Kubernetes clusters.
- Ensure that the deployment process is automated and can be replicated in other environments if needed.
