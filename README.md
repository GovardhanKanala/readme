# Kyverno Implementation Guide

## Learning Phase

**User Story 1:**  
As a DevOps engineer, I want to read the official Kyverno documentation so that I can understand its capabilities and features.

**User Story 2:**  
As a DevOps engineer, I want to set up a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube or Kind so that I can experiment with Kyverno in a controlled environment.

**User Story 3:**  
As a DevOps engineer, I want to install Kyverno on my local cluster so that I can start applying and testing policies.

**User Story 4:**  
As a DevOps engineer, I want to apply sample Kyverno policies from the GitHub repository so that I can learn how they function and their impact on workloads.

## Development Phase

**User Story 5:**  
As a policy developer, I want to create custom Kyverno policies based on my organization's requirements so that I can enforce specific rules in our Kubernetes environment.

**User Story 6:**  
As a policy developer, I want to validate my policies using kubectl commands before applying them so that I can ensure they are correctly configured.

**User Story 7:**  
As a QA engineer, I want to write unit tests for Kyverno policies using the Kyverno CLI so that I can ensure policies behave as expected.

**User Story 8:**  
As a QA engineer, I want to deploy policies in a staging environment and test their behavior with different workloads so that I can verify their effectiveness.

## Integration Phase

**User Story 9:**  
As a CI/CD engineer, I want to integrate Kyverno policy validation in our GitHub Actions workflow so that policies are validated before deploying to production.

**User Story 10:**  
As a DevOps engineer, I want to integrate Kyverno policy checks in our Terraform pipeline so that infrastructure deployments adhere to defined policies.

**User Story 11:**  
As a DevOps engineer, I want to decide on the enforcement mode for each policy (audit or enforce) so that we can gather policy violations without blocking resources initially.

**User Story 12:**  
As a DevOps engineer, I want to regularly review Kyverno policy reports and address violations so that our Kubernetes environment remains compliant.

## Production Phase

**User Story 13:**  
As a DevOps engineer, I want to gradually roll out Kyverno policies to production by enabling enforce mode on non-critical namespaces first so that we minimize the risk of disruptions.

**User Story 14:**  
As a DevOps engineer, I want to continuously monitor policy reports and logs to ensure policies are functioning as expected in production.

**User Story 15:**  
As a policy developer, I want to regularly update policies based on new requirements and feedback so that our Kubernetes environment remains secure and compliant.

**User Story 16:**  
As a DevOps engineer, I want to stay engaged with the Kyverno community for updates, best practices, and support so that we can leverage the latest improvements and solutions.
