# Kyverno Custom Helm Chart

## Overview

This repository contains a custom Helm chart for deploying Kyverno policies across different Kubernetes environments (dev, beta, stg, prod). The chart allows for easy deployment, management, and customization of Kyverno in a scalable and consistent manner.

## User Story

**As a DevOps Engineer, I want to create a custom Helm chart for Kyverno so that I can easily deploy and manage Kyverno policies across different Kubernetes environments.**

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Helm Chart Initialization
- The Helm chart is structured with:
  - `Chart.yaml`
  - `values.yaml`
  - Necessary templates: `deployment.yaml`, `service.yaml`, etc.
- The chart includes all required Kubernetes resources for Kyverno (e.g., `ClusterPolicy`, `Policy`, `ConfigMap`, `Secret`, `ServiceAccount`, `Role`, `RoleBinding`).

### 2. Customizable Parameters
- `values.yaml` includes:
  - Image repository and tag.
  - Resource limits and requests (CPU, memory).
  - Replica count for Kyverno pods.
  - Namespace configuration.
  - Service account annotations and labels.
  - Node selectors, affinity, and tolerations for pod scheduling.
  - Kyverno policy configurations (e.g., policy categories, logging levels, webhook settings).

### 3. Environment-Specific Values
- Separate values files are provided for each environment:
  - `values-dev.yaml`
  - `values-beta.yaml`
  - `values-stg.yaml`
  - `values-prod.yaml`
- Each environment is configured with appropriate settings for resource limits, replica counts, and logging levels.

### 4. Security and Compliance
- The Helm chart includes secure defaults, such as:
  - Non-root containers.
  - Necessary RBAC permissions.
- Integration options with external secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) are available.

### 5. Testing and Validation
- `helm test` templates validate deployment in each environment.
- The chart passes validation checks (`helm lint` returns no errors).
- Integration testing ensures Kyverno policies are correctly applied and enforced.

### 6. Documentation
- Comprehensive documentation is included, covering:
  - Installation instructions.
  - Environment-specific configurations.
  - Customization of Kyverno policies.
- A changelog file tracks updates and changes to the Helm chart.

### 7. Deployment Automation
- Deployment is automated using GitHub Actions, with integration into the CI/CD pipeline.
- Deployments to each environment are triggered automatically on branch merges (`dev`, `beta`, `stg`, `prod`).

### 8. Rollback Mechanism
- A rollback mechanism is implemented to revert to previous Kyverno deployments if issues arise.
- The rollback procedure is documented within the Helm chart documentation.

### 9. Review and Approval
- Approval from key stakeholders (security, operations) is obtained before finalizing the Helm chart.
- Feedback is addressed and incorporated into the final chart.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Kubernetes cluster (1.19+)
- Helm 3.x
- Access to a container registry for Kyverno images

### Installation

1. **Add the Helm repository:**

   ```bash
   helm repo add kyverno-custom https://your-repo-url/kyverno-custom
   helm repo update


Install the Helm chart:

bash
Copy code
helm install kyverno kyverno-custom/kyverno -f values-dev.yaml
Customize the installation by modifying values.yaml or using environment-specific files.

Testing
Run the following command to validate the installation:

bash
Copy code
helm test kyverno
Rollback
If an issue is encountered, revert to the previous deployment:

bash
Copy code
helm rollback kyverno <revision>
